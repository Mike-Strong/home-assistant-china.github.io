    <content type="html"><![CDATA[This new release finally brings us the release of Hassbian based on the release of Raspbian Stretch. The most significant change with this is that we now run Home Assistant on Python 3.5.
Other than that the changes are mostly to our tool `hassbian-config`.

### <a class='title-link' name='hassbian-config' href='#hassbian-config'></a> Hassbian-config 

To allow you to customize your installation further, we have made a few additions to our tool called `hassbian-config`. Majority of these changes where contributed by [@Ludeeus][ludeeus].

    <link href="http:///blog/2017/06/15/zwave-entity-ids/"/>
    <updated>2017-06-15T20:00:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http:///blog/2017/06/15/zwave-entity-ids</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ZWave entity_ids have long been a source of frustration in Home Assistant. The first problem we faced was that depending on the order of node discovery, entity_ids could be discovered with different names on each run. To solve this we added the node id as a suffix to the entity_id. This ensured that entity_ids were generated deterministically on each run, but additional suffixes had to be added to handle edge cases where there would otherwise be a conflict. The resulting entity_ids worked, but have been difficult to work with and makes ZWave a strange exception among other Home Assistant components.

Thanks to the awesome work of [@turbokongen], a growing number of ZWave configuration options are now available from the new ZWave panel in the Home Assistant frontend. Among these new features is support for renaming of ZWave nodes and their underlying values. (These renames are persisted in zwcfg_*.xml) This is important, because these items are combined to form the Home Assistant entity name, which is used to generate the entity_id. Now that these options are available, ZWave users can rename nodes and values, influencing the entity_ids that are generated by Home Assistant.

Now that users are able to control these names, we will be making changes to how the entity_ids are generated for ZWave entities. The ZWave entity_ids are going to switch back to using the standard entity_id generation from Home Assistant core, based on the entity names. Moving forward, if there is a conflict when generating entity_ids, a suffix will be added, and it will be the responsibility of the user to rename their nodes and values to avoid the conflict. This is the same as any other platform in Home Assistant where two devices are discovered with the same name.

With the release of 0.47, this feature will be opt-in. Setting `new_entity_ids: true` under `zwave:` in your configuration.yaml will enable the new generation. After 0.48 this feature will become opt-out. From 0.48 onward, unless you’ve declared `new_entity_ids: false` you will switch to the new entity_id generation. At an undecided point in the future, the old entity_id generation will be removed completely.

I’m sure all ZWave users understand that the current entity_ids aren’t easy to use. They’re annoying to type in configuration.yaml, and break if a node needs to be re-included to the network. We know that breaking changes are painful, and so we’re doing what we can to roll this change out as smoothly as possible. The end result should be a dramatic simplification of most ZWave configurations. We hope that this change will ultimately make ZWave much easier to work with, and bring ZWave configuration just a little closer to the rest of the Home Assistant platforms.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[### Hassbian 1.21 - It's about time isn't it
Since I, the developer of HASSbian, have been moving, started a new job and so on I've had few moments over for HASSbian development. The 1.2 release has been in pre-release for a few months now and just not communicated out that well. Hopefully this release changes that and I'll do my best to release more often. There's no simple way to update from 1.1 to 1.21 but 95% of the changes can be done by installing the [hassbian-config][hassbian-config-release] package. For more information have a look at the [hassbian-config][hassbian-repo] page.

### Hassbian 1.22 - Sins of last night
Development is sometimes fast and joyful but mistakes are made at times.

With the release of 1.21 a small problem with the OpenZWave build script wasn't corrected even tough it was a known bug. Problem is simple as it's only a problem with the symlink created for to the configuration folder for OpenZWave. This has been fixed and we bring some new things since they where ready anyway. The list below has been augmented with the updated information.

### <a class='title-link' name='hassbian-config' href='#hassbian-config'></a> Hassbian-config 

To allow you to customize your installation further, we have included a tool called `hassbian-config`. This tool comes with a set of packages that can easily be installed for easier customization of your Home Assistant installation. This replaces the `hassbian-scripts` functionality from 1.1.

  - Install Hue. Configures the Python executable to allow usage of low numbered ports for use with Emulated Hue component thats used with Amazon Echo, Google Home and Mycroft.ai.
 - Install Mosquitto MQTT server. Installs the latest Mosquitto package and client tools from the Mosquitto projects official repository. Now includes websocket support.
 - Install Libcec. Adds local [HDMI CEC support][cec].
 - Install Open Z-Wave-pip. Installs Python Open Z-Wave from a pip package. This is the quickest and recommended way of installing Z-Wave support but does not OZWCP pre-installed.
 - Install Open Z-Wave. Installs Python Open Z-Wave and OZWCP from git.
 - Install Samba. Allows anyone on your network to edit your configuration from any computer. This share is unsecured and it's usage is not recommended if you share your network with others.
 - Install Tellstick. Installs the Tellstick package for controlling and using a connected Tellstick.
 - Install Tradfri. Installs dependencies for using IKEA Trådfri.

### <a class='title-link' name='spring-cleaning' href='#spring-cleaning'></a> Spring cleaning 

With this image there also quite a bit of cleaning of the base system and the script that generates our Raspberry Pi image.

  - Replaced the `hassbian-scripts` folder with `hassbian-config`.
  - Update `pi-gen`. Our build script has been upgraded to follow the Raspbian image closer once again. Now you could build this image with Docker if your so inclined.
  - Added libtool and autoconf package. Dependencies for some of the pip packages.
  - Pi ZeroW should now work with the image.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Tonight I'm happy to announce a new release of the our Raspberry Pi image, **HASSbian 1.1 - The Toy-box.**  
Why Toy-box you wonder? Because it encompass the changes pretty well.

Changes from previous image are big and small but lets start with the interesting things.

### <a class='title-link' name='hassbian-scripts' href='#hassbian-scripts'></a> Hassbian-scripts 
A set of script written to add extra functionality to your Raspberry Pi installation. 
This scripts are run as the `pi` user and installs a set of tools or packages.
Currently includes:
 - Install Libcec. Adds local [HDMI CEC support][cec].
 - Install Mossquitto. Installs the latest Mosquitto package and client tools from the Mosquitto projects official repository. Now includes websocket support.
 - Install OpenZWave. Installs OpenZWave and prepares for using a USB or GPIO ZWave controller.
 - Install Samba. Installs the Samba packages and shares your configuration over smb to be available to edit on any computer without the need for separate file transfer software. This share is unsecured and it's usage is not recommended if your installation is publicly available.

All of these scripts are available in the directory `/home/pi/hassbian-scripts/`. This directory is actually a cloned git repository that's cloned on first boot and can be updated to the latest release with ease after.
To update the hassbian-scripts directory execute the following command as the `pi` user.
```bash
$ cd hassbian-scripts
$ git pull
```
To use any of the hassbian-scripts, execute the following command as the `pi` user. Here we use the libcec script as an example.
```bash
$ sudo ./hassbian-scripts/install_libcec.sh
```

For more information about these scripts have a look a the [hassbian-scripts repository][hassbian-repo]. 

### <a class='title-link' name='spring-cleaning' href='#spring-cleaning'></a> Spring cleaning 
With this image there also quite a bit of cleaning of the base system and the script that generates our Raspberry Pi image.
 - Update pi-gen. Our build script has been upgraded to follow the Raspbian image closer. This image is basically a Raspbian lite image with Home Assistant, dependencies and a small set of changes to the base system.
 - Removed Mosquitto. Not as bad as it sounds since it's installation has been move to one of our new hassbian-scripts.
 - Added rng-tools. Let's your HASSbian installation use the hardware support in the Raspberry Pi for entropy generation.
 - Added avahi-daemon package. Your Raspberry Pi should now be available at [hassbian.local][hassbian-avahi]. 
 - Added htop. User friendly interactive process monitor.
 - Added tmux. A great terminal multiplexer that makes working with the command line over ssh easier.
 - Added the `homeassistant` user to the `dialout` group. Simplifies use of hardware such as ZWave USB controllers that requires this permission.
 
### <a class='title-link' name='on-the-horizon' href='#on-the-horizon'></a> On the horizon 
There's of course more on the horizon and there's even more plans and wishes for how this image will function in the future.
On the close horizon from [@Landrash][landrash-github] there a few more script in the works and for tellstick, emulated_hue and for controlling Home Assistant.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Today we're happy to announce our brand new Raspberry Pi image! It is based on Raspbian Lite combined with HASS so we decided to call it Hassbian.

This image comes pre-installed with everything you need to get started with Home Assistant right away.

To get started, check out the installation instructions in [the getting started section][gs-image] or watch the latest video by [BRUHAutomation]:

</div>

### <a class='title-link' name='under-the-hood' href='#under-the-hood'></a> Under the hood 

It's based on Raspbian Lite and generated with a fork of the same [script](https://github.com/home-assistant/pi-gen) that builds the [official Raspbian images](https://raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/). For installation of HASS it follows the same install instructions as the [Manual installation](/getting-started/installation-raspberry-pi/). Please note that this project has no association with the Raspberry Pi foundation or their projects.

On first boot the latest release of Home Assistant will be installed and can be reached after 3~5 minutes. Pre-installed on this image is the MQTT broker [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/), Bluetooth support and settings for the `homeassistant` account to use the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi. Mosquitto is not activated by default.

As it is today there is no pre-compiled Z-Wave support but it can be installed by following the [Getting started instructions for Z-Wave](/getting-started/z-wave/).

Happy Automating!
